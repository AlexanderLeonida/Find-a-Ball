# Find-a-Ball
OpenCV and Pytorch / Scikit-learn in Python to predict a ball!

## The Objective 

The goal of this project is to be able to train my own LSTM neural net model in order to demonstrate and lern new skills!

On a larger scale, something like this could be used to predict any example of user input (Ex. movement of a character in a game).
